# Problem 1

## Problem 1 (a)

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

numaisle_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "n_items")
```

``` r
numaisle_df %>% 
  filter(n_items > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n_items)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_items)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.4, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 1 (b)

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
popitem_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(n_ord = n()) %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  mutate(
    ord_rank = min_rank(desc(n_ord))
  ) %>% 
  filter(ord_rank < 4) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

## Problem 1 (c)

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
meanh_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_hod = mean(order_hour_of_day, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow",
    values_from = "mean_hod",
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
### need to indicate day (from number 0-6 to day)
```

# Problem 2

## Problem 2 (a)

First, do some data cleaning:

1.  format the data to use appropriate variable names;
2.  focus on the “Overall Health” topic;
3.  include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”;
4.  organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
    “Excellent”.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss_df = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(
    topic %in% "Overall Health",
    response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))
    )
```

## Problem 2 (b)

Using this dataset, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

1.  In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
    about in 2010?;
2.  Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
    contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
    across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this
    average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing
    a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and
    group aesthetic will help).;
3.  Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
    distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”)
    among locations in NY State.

``` r
health_02 = 
  brfss_df %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_loc = n()) %>% 
  filter(
    year == 2002,
    n_loc > 6
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
health_10 = 
  brfss_df %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc) %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_loc = n()) %>% 
  filter(
    year == 2010,
    n_loc > 6
    )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
health_exc = 
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  mutate(
    mean_data_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, mean_data_value) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data_value, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "State",
    discrete = TRUE
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

health_dis =
  brfss_df %>% 
  filter(
    locationabbr %in% "NY",
    year %in% c(2006, 2010)
    ) %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, response, data_value) %>% 
  drop_na(data_value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.4, hjust = 1))
```

# Problem 3

## Problem 3(a)

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset

``` r
accel_df = 
  read.csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "min",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    min = as.numeric(min),
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")),
    weekend = as.numeric(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
  ) 
```

## Problem 3(b)

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accelto_df = 
  accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_act = sum(activity)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "total_act"
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

## Problem 3(c)

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph

``` r
accelplot_df = 
  accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = min, y = activity, color = day)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .3) +
  geom_smooth()
```
